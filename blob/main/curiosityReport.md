# Curiosity Report: HAR Files
## Why I Chose This Topic:
In our class, for our load testing deliverable, we uploaded a HAR file to Grafana to help us get a good jumpstart on our K6 tests. I was extremely curious as to what this file actually was because we just brushed over it, and it seemed to do a lot for us. I knew this tracked our requests done on the browser, but I wanted to know more, including what these files could be used for and what they all contain.
## What is a HAR File
A HAR file is a JSON-formatted log of all network requests and responses between a web browser and a website. This file is primarily used by developers for troubleshooting website performance and debugging possible issues like slow load times, network problems, or failed requests. It does this by providing information about the page's resources, timing, headers, and cookies. 
## What a HAR file contains
- **Requests and Responses:** Full details of every HTTP request and response, including headers, status codes, and cookies during a recording. 
- **Timing:** Detailed timing information for each resource, showing how long it took to load.
- **Payload data:** The content or body of the requests and responses.
- **Other metrics:** Information like the size of resources and other performance-related data.
